        <li> <strong>What series do we stream?</strong> </li>
        <p>
          We currently support most Motorsport and Football/Soccer matches, most notably F1, IndyCar, NASCAR, Premier League, and La Liga <br>
          If you don't see your desired series, it's because it isn't popular enough or there hasn't been enough requests for us to add it. Keep in mind we'll never go chasing after each and every individual request people make otherwise it would be impossible to keep up. 
        </p>

        <li> <strong>What is the best stream?</strong> </li>
        <p>
          Stream 1 will always be the best stream. <br>
          If you are in Asia, the stream with the Malaysian flag should be the best, as it is broadcasted by Bein Sports from Malaysia.
        </p>

        <li> <strong>Why a stream doesn't display anything?</strong> </li>
        <p>
          If the streams don‚Äôt work, there are a couple reasons why: <br>
          - If it says ‚Äúthe server address could not be resolved, your firewall or ISP are probably blocking the source. <br>
          - If it says that this video file could not be played, the stream is geo blocked. <br>
          - It is known that the Italian stream is geo blocked. <br>
          - Any other issues, please contact us on discord (state that you read FAQ so we won‚Äôt make a ü§° out of you).
        </p>

        <li> <strong>Why are there no replays?</strong> </li>
        <p>
          After careful consideration, we have decided to not host or support replays as it will be a high maintenance procedure (and cost a lot of money). <br>
          It also constitutes a high risk for us, as it drastically increase the chances of getting the site taken down with probable cause. <br>
          We encourage you to perform a quick Google search to find the replays you are looking for. Thank you for your comprehension.
